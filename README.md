# Case-study-in-machine-learning

* This is one of the courses in Coursera which gets hands-on experience with machine learning from a series of practical case-studies. - october 2020*

** Note: The entire programming exercises are done with the `turicreate` package which cannot be run on my own computer; and the SFrame data is too heavy which cannot be uploaded on github. Therefore, all data and programming codes are stored in [my Google Colab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fpGzTX6FYNnRq42a2VozhCPz5jAOUygl).**

## Objectives

- Identify potential applications of machine learning in practice.  
- Describe the core differences in analyses enabled by regression, classification, and clustering.
- Select the appropriate machine learning task for a potential application.  
- Apply regression, classification, clustering, retrieval, recommender systems, and deep learning.
- Represent your data as features to serve as input to machine learning models. 
- Assess the model quality in terms of relevant error metrics for each task.
- Utilize a dataset to fit a model to analyze new data.
- Build an end-to-end application that uses machine learning at its core.  
- Implement these techniques in Python.

## Syllabus

#### Module 1: Introduce

- Be familiar with the Sframe data structure and the use of `turicreate`.

#### Module 2: Regression - Predicting House Prices

- Create models that predict a continuous value (house price) from input features (square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms,...).
- Analyze the performance of the predictive model.
- Implement regression in practice.

#### Module 3: Classification - Analyzing Sentiment

- Create models that predict a class (positive/negative sentiment) from input features (text of the reviews, user profile information,...).
- Analyze the accuracy of your classifier.
- Implement an actual classifier.

#### Module 4: Clustering and Similarity - Retrieving Documents

- Examine various document representations and an algorithm to retrieve the most similar subset.
- Consider structured representations of the documents that automatically group articles by similarity (e.g., document topic).
- Build an intelligent document retrieval system for Wikipedia entries.

#### Module 5: Recommender systems

- Build a recommender system using a variety of techniques, and explore their tradeoffs.
- Technique used: matrix factorization, which learns features of users and products to form recommendations.

#### Module 6: Deep Learning - Searching for Images

- Learn how layers of neural networks provide very descriptive (non-linear) features that provide impressive performance in image classification and retrieval tasks.
- Construct deep features, a transfer learning technique that allows you to use deep learning very easily.
- Build an image classifier and an intelligent image retrieval system with deep learning.
